# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

========================================================================
To create the contact list app with the mentioned features, you can follow these steps:

Set up a new React project by running the following command in your terminal:
shell
Copy code
npx create-react-app contact-list-app
Change into the project directory:
shell
Copy code
cd contact-list-app
Open the project in your preferred code editor.

Install required dependencies:

shell
Copy code
npm install axios react-router-dom
The axios library will be used for making HTTP requests, and react-router-dom for handling routing.

Create a new folder named src/components to store the components for your application.

Inside the src/components folder, create a new file named ContactList.js. This file will display the list of contacts fetched from the API.

Create another file named AddContact.js inside the src/components folder. This component will allow users to add a new contact.

Create a file named App.js in the src folder, which will serve as the entry point for your app and handle routing.

Finally, you can start the application by running the following command in the terminal:npm start

 note that the API used in this example (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) is a dummy API and does not actually store any data. Therefore, the POST, PUT, and DELETE requests will not have any effect on the server-side. However, the code is structured in a way that you can easily modify it to work with a real API.
